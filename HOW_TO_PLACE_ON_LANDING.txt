Landing Card Placement (IMPORTANT)

You said the card must be under the "Ücretsiz Başla" buttons on the landing page.

This patch DOES NOT overwrite your landing page file (to avoid conflicts).
You must add ONE line to your landing page component:

1) Open: app/page.tsx   (landing /)
2) Add import near top:
   import { InstallLandingCard } from "@/components/InstallLandingCard";

3) In JSX, place it right under the "Ücretsiz Başla" / action buttons area:

   <div className="mt-4">
     <InstallLandingCard />
   </div>

After that, the card will show ONLY on landing page (because you only render it there).

Modal behavior:
- Full-screen on mobile (100dvh/100dvw)
- No horizontal scroll
